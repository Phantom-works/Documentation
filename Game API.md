## RAWG vs IGDB

The RAWG API and the IGDB API are both video game APIs that provide information on games, developers, platforms, and other related data. However, there are some differences between them:

1. Data Coverage: The RAWG API has a more extensive data coverage, with over 500,000 games in its database, while the IGDB API has around 200,000 games.

2. Data Quality: Both APIs provide high-quality data, but RAWG API relies on user contributions to update and verify data, while IGDB API has a team of editors that review and update the data.

3. Pricing: The RAWG API offers a free plan that includes 1000 requests per day, while the IGDB API offers a free plan with limited access and a paid plan for higher usage.

4. Features: Both APIs offer similar features such as game search, game details, and reviews, but the RAWG API also provides game recommendations, collections, and user profiles, while the IGDB API has a more advanced search capability with a range of filters.

5. API Structure: The RAWG API is RESTful, while the IGDB API uses GraphQL. RESTful APIs rely on endpoints to access resources, while GraphQL APIs allow clients to specify the data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.

In summary, the main differences between the RAWG API and the IGDB API are data coverage, data quality, pricing, features, and API structure. The choice between the two would depend on the specific requirements of the project and the preference of the developer.
